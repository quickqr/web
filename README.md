# Quick QR Website [SUSPENDED]
A website to easily interact with QQR's API and preview QR codes. Can be used to share QR code configuration.

* This project is archived because I lost interest in programming client-side code. So, if anyone wants to continue it, please fork this repo and then contact me somehow and we'll do PR <3

# Techonogies
- Vite + SolidJS
- SASS for styling

# Current problems
- Pretty much no adaptivity 
- Issues with floating windows like color picker and dropdown menu (some code for dynamic placing should be added to fix this)
- Occasional TODOs in code.
